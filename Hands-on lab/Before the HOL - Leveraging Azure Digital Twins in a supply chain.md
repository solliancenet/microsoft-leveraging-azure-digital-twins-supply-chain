## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 25 minutes

### Task 1: Create the lab resource group

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), expand the left menu and select **Resource groups**.

    ![The left menu of the Azure Portal displays with the Resource groups item selected.](media/azureleftmenu_resourcegroups.png "Azure Portal left menu")

2. Select **+ Add** from the top toolbar menu, and create a resource group for this lab. Name the resource group: **mcw-adt-supply-chain**.

3. For the **Region**, select a [region that supports Azure Digital Twins](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/).

### Task 2: Deploy the necessary Azure resources

1. Deploy the ARM template (CTRL/Command + left click the image below to open in a new tab):

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fsolliancenet%2Fmicrosoft-leveraging-azure-digital-twins-supply-chain%2Fmain%2FHands-on%2520lab%2FResources%2Fdeployment%2FARM%2Fdigtwins-template-agad.json" target="_blank">

      </a>

2. Configure the following fields:

    | Field | Value |
    |--------|--------|
    | Subscription | Select the desired subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select the lab resource group you created in the previous step. |
    | Location | Select the Region where to deploy the resources. Keep in mind that all resources will be deployed to this region. |
    | Prefix | The template will generate a unique ID once you start your deployment. Alternatively, you can enter your own prefix. |

3. Select **Review + create**.

4. Select **Create**.

This ARM template will deploy the services necessary to support this lab. You can refer to the Solution architecture in the Hands-on lab for a visualization. The services deployed include:

1. Azure Digital Twins

2. Function App

3. Event Grid Topic

4. Event Hubs Namespace

5. IoT Hub

6. App Service plan

7. Logic app

8. Storage account

9. Time Series Insights environment

10. Time Series Insights event source

11. SignalR

## Task 3: Download the lab files

Download the lab artifacts from GitHub.

1. In a web browser, navigate to the [Leveraging Azure Digital Twins in a supply chain GitHub repo](https://github.com/solliancenet/microsoft-leveraging-azure-digital-twins-supply-chain).

2. On the repo page, expand the **Code**, then select **Download ZIP**.

   ![Download .zip containing the repository](media/github-download-repo.png 'Download ZIP')

3. Unzip the contents to your root hard drive (i.e., `C:\`).
